<p align="center">I built this tribute page to Marie Curie to obtain the "Responsive Web Design" certificate on Freecodecamp.org. I chose neon green color to highlight some elements because it reminds me of radioactivity. Radioactivity itself does not have a color, but the vibrant green hue of neon brings to mind its energy and intensity. It adds a visual connection to the subject matter and creates an engaging atmosphere. The page features a hamburger menu built with CSS and JS, which provided valuable practice and allowed me to enhance my skills. Additionally, designing the timeline presented a significant challenge, but the process proved to be highly beneficial for my learning experience.</p>
