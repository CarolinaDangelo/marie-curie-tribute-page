Página tributo para certificación FreeCodeCamp.org

<p align="center">I built this tribute page to Marie Curie to obtain the "Responsive Web Design" certificate on Freecodecamp.org. I chose neon green color to highlight some elements because it reminds me of radioactivity. It has a hamburger menu built with CSS and JS, and it was a good practice to create it. Similarly, the timeline was quite a challenge, but it was very beneficial for my learning experience.</p>

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
