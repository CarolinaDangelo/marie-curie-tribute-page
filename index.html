                <h3>Maria Salomea Skłodowska-Curie <span class="apodo">
                        Madame Curie</span></h3>
                <p>Marie Curie was a passionate scientist and a pioneer in the field of
                    <span class="radio">radioactivity</span>. She was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1867. Her curiosity and
                    thirst for knowledge led her to study at the University of Sorbonne in Paris,
                    where she met her husband, Pierre Curie. Together, they discovered radioactivity
                    and were awarded two Nobel Prizes. Despite the gender barriers of her time,
                    Marie Curie dedicated herself passionately to science and paved the way for
                    women in the field. Additionally, she utilized her knowledge during World War
                    I to help save lives. Marie Curie is an inspiring figure whose legacy goes
                    beyond her scientific discoveries.
                </p>
                <h3>Some things that made her stand out:</h3>
                <p><span class="radio">Scientific Contributions:</span> Marie Curie made
                    significant discoveries in the field of radioactivity, including the
                    isolation of the elements radium and polonium. Her research laid the
                    foundation for further developments in nuclear physics and radiological
                    medicine.<br><br>

                    <span class="radio">Nobel Prizes:</span> Marie Curie became the first woman to receive a Nobel
                    Prize, and to this day, she remains the only person to have received Nobel Prizes in different
                    scientific disciplines. She won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
                    in 1911, highlighting her exceptional contribution to science.<br><br>

                    <span class="radio">Leadership and Inspiration:</span> Marie Curie challenged the gender barriers of
                    her time and excelled as a leading scientist in a male-dominated field. Her dedication, passion, and
                    determination serve as a source of inspiration for women and scientists worldwide.<br><br>

                    <span class="radio">Enduring Legacy:</span> Marie Curie's findings and research laid the groundwork
                    for the development of nuclear medicine, radiation therapy, and radioactive chemistry. Her work has
                    had a significant impact on science and medicine, and her contributions remain relevant to this
                    day.<br><br>

                    <span class="radio">Commitment to Humanity:</span> During World War I, Marie Curie contributed to
                    the war effort by establishing mobile radiography units and training technicians in radiology. Her
                    efforts helped save thousands of lives and demonstrated her commitment to the well-being of
                    humanity.
